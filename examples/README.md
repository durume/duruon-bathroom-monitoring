Configuration examples moved here. Copy one as a starting point and adjust.

Files:
- config_practical.yaml: More conservative (long soft delay, moderate thresholds)
- config_test_sensitive.yaml: Faster, more sensitive for test sessions
- config_mock.yaml: Mock backend + dummy notifier
- config_test.yaml: Legacy simple test baseline
