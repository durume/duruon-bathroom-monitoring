Configuration examples directory.

Files:
- config_practical.yaml: More conservative (long soft delay, moderate thresholds)
- config_test_sensitive.yaml: Faster, more sensitive for test sessions
- config_mock.yaml: Mock backend + dummy notifier
- legacy/config_test.yaml: Legacy simple test baseline (kept for reference, not recommended)

Removed from project root during cleanup to reduce clutter. Use `config.yaml` or copy one of these to a new file for customization.
